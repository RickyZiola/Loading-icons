# Loading-icons
Java loading icons, a spinner and a progress bar
They a are accessed by making an Icon object. By default they are type 0 (none). 
You can change the type to a spinner that cycles through these chars: |/-\ and a progress bar.
The progress bar uses a full block character to create a loading bar.
Both types show custom text and the percent complete.
Type none, when updated, clears the line (up to 100 chars long)
